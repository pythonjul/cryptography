<p align = "center">ðŸ’¡ In 2019, I have implemented these algorithms in python</p>



## Why I made this project? <a name = "why_document"></a>

- During a class on cryptography in UNIGE, we had as a project to implement DES and RSA. 

## How use it<a name = "how_to_play"></a>

**What is it:**

- [Data Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard)
- [Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)

**DES:**

- At the end of the file, you can insert the message of your choice in the variable `message_test`.
- Just after, you can insert the key of your choice in the variable `cle_test`.
- Then you can use [this website](http://des.online-domain-tools.com/) or something similar for the test in the if test.
- Finally execute the python des file.

**AES:**

- At the end of the file, you can modify the variable `message` as you wish. Then when you execute the python file, you might observe the given cipher and the decrypted message.
